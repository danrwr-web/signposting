# Signposting Toolkit — Release Notes

A high-level history of major changes.

---

## Unreleased

_Changes in development or planned for the next release._

### ✨ New
- Redesigned marketing landing page with clearer hero, benefits strip, and 3-step "How it works" section.
- Added trust section highlighting GP-built origins and local clinical control.
- User Guide link restored in marketing site navigation alongside Docs link.
- Added a public FAQs page covering setup, governance, and optional AI tools (linked from the marketing navigation).

### 🧹 Updated
- AI questions panel now titled "Suggested wording for questions to ask" with supporting text to encourage safe, consistent phrasing.
- Clicking the Signposting Toolkit logo now keeps you within your current surgery, with `/s` as a safer signed-in entry route (avoids losing context and unexpected login redirects).
- Symptom page links now use the same surgery identifier as the main `/s/[id]` routes, with older links automatically redirected to the canonical format.
- Surgery admins can now apply AI wording suggestions within their own surgery (superusers remain supported).
- Admin forms no longer ask for symptom slugs — slugs are generated automatically, and high-risk buttons now link to symptoms via a searchable list.
- Symptom search and clinical review counts now refresh immediately after creating, approving, enabling, or deleting symptoms (no 5‑minute delay).
- Marketing and app domains separated: www.signpostingtool.co.uk shows the public site while app.signpostingtool.co.uk routes straight into the toolkit entry screen.
- Marketing site hero updated with new headline: "The GP Signposting Toolkit for safer, faster care navigation".
- "Why practices choose" section condensed and moved higher on the landing page.
- Docs site logo now links to www.signpostingtool.co.uk (marketing homepage).
- All marketing site CTAs verified to use app.signpostingtool.co.uk.
- Landing page now frames AI as optional tools, adds onboarding and support copy, and links to the FAQs for common governance questions.
