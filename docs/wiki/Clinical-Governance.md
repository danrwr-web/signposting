# Clinical Governance

The Signposting Toolkit includes a structured clinical governance framework to ensure all symptom instructions used by reception and care-navigation teams are safe, accurate, and up to date.  

The aim is simple: **to support consistent, defensible decision-making**, while ensuring that the content used by non-clinical staff is clinically validated.

This governance model has been designed with NHS primary care standards in mind and can be overseen by a GP practice, a multi-site organisation, or a PCN.

## Why governance matters

Reception and care-navigation teams handle a large volume of patient contacts every day. They must quickly decide:

- whether something is high-risk  

- whether a patient requires urgent assessment  

- whether symptoms can be managed by an alternative service  

- which clinician or appointment type is most appropriate  

The toolkit provides clarity, but **clarity must be correct**. Clinical oversight ensures that all information:

- aligns with local processes  

- reflects current best practice  

- is safe for non-clinical staff to use  

- avoids accidental propagation of outdated guidance  

---

## Governance responsibilities

Each organisation using the toolkit should identify the following roles:

### **Clinical Lead (GP, ANP, or Pharmacist)**

Responsible for:

- reviewing and approving symptom instructions  

- validating high-risk flags and highlighted phrases  

- ensuring local pathways are correctly represented  

- periodic review of existing content  

- signing off major updates and AI-generated changes  

### **Surgery / PCN Admin Lead**

Responsible for:

- creating or editing symptoms  

- drafting updates and amendments  

- managing local overrides  

- ensuring reception feedback is incorporated  

- coordinating review cycles with the Clinical Lead  

### **Reception & Care-Navigation Team**

Responsible for:

- using approved guidance  

- highlighting unclear, outdated, or missing instructions  

- reporting high-risk patterns or common points of confusion  

---

## Governance workflow

All symptom instructions move through three clear states:

### **1. Draft**

- Created by Admin or Clinical Lead  

- Visible only to Admins and reviewers  

- Not shown to reception teams  

- Can include AI-generated content (before review)  

### **2. Submitted for Review**

- Indicates the symptom is ready for clinical validation  

- Clinical Lead reviews the wording, safety cues, and accuracy  

- Can request changes or send back to Draft  

### **3. Approved**

- Fully validated content  

- Visible to reception and care-navigation staff  

- Locked from public editing unless changes are explicitly made  

- Forms part of the organisation's formal governance record  

Approved symptoms represent the **current, safe, clinically-endorsed guidance** for frontline signposting decisions.

## Using AI safely

The toolkit includes AI tools to improve clarity — *not* to generate clinical advice.

All AI assistance:

- rewrites staff instructions for clarity  

- cannot publish directly to the live library  

- must be reviewed and approved by a Clinical Lead  

This ensures AI output supports readability without bypassing clinical oversight.

> ⚠️ **AI content is never published automatically.  

> Clinical review is mandatory.**

## Customisation and local variation

Practices and PCNs differ in:

- available clinicians  

- preferred pathways  

- access to local services  

- configurations for children vs adults  

- appointment types  

- safeguarding and escalation policies  

The system allows each organisation to create local overrides that:

- adapt base symptoms  

- add local rules  

- adjust high-risk wording  

- reflect local skill-mix and availability  

This ensures the live symptom library always reflects **how your practice actually works**.

---

## Periodic review

To maintain accuracy, organisations should review their symptom library at least annually, and more often when:

- local pathways change  

- workforce or skill-mix shifts  

- NICE or NHS England guidance is updated  

- feedback from reception indicates confusion or ambiguity  

The toolkit supports this by allowing:

- filtering by last review date  

- tracking previously approved changes  

- quickly identifying symptoms pending review  

---

## Governance in multi-surgery or PCN environments

The Signposting Toolkit supports shared governance across:

- federated practices  

- multi-site surgeries  

- PCNs with centralised triage or care navigation  

Options include:

- each surgery having its own Clinical Lead and Admin team  

- a PCN-level governance group approving base content  

- shared symptom sets with local variation  

This flexibility ensures governance scales with organisational structure.

---

## Summary

The governance model ensures that:

- staff use **consistent, safe, clinically validated instructions**  

- high-risk cues and escalation points are clearly highlighted  

- local workflows and services are accurately reflected  

- AI suggestions are always reviewed by a clinician  

- organisations maintain a clear audit trail of changes  

By combining robust governance with clarity for frontline teams, the Signposting Toolkit strengthens patient safety while reducing variation in signposting decisions.
