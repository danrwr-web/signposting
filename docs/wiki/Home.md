## Overview

The Signposting Toolkit is a multi-surgery GP signposting and care-navigation web application used by primary care teams to route patients safely and consistently. It replaces guesswork with clarity — helping teams make the same safe decisions even on the busiest days.

Developed inside a working NHS practice, the toolkit provides structured, clinically-approved guidance for care navigation, supported by modern AI tools, local customisation, and robust governance.
