## Overview

Daily Dose is a short, Duolingo-style learning session designed for GP practice teams. It supports reception, nursing, and prescribing teams with 5–10 minute learning that fits into busy shifts.

Each session is built from approved learning cards. Cards include quick interactions and explanations, plus clear sources and a review date.

---

## Who it is for

Daily Dose supports three tracks:

- **GP / Prescriber**
- **Nurse / HCA**
- **Admin / Reception**

Each track can focus on different topics, so staff see what matters most for their role.

---

## How a session works

1. **Core card** – a new or due card for review.
2. **Embedded questions** – staff must answer before the explanation is shown.
3. **Quick quiz** – 3–6 questions from today’s learning and due reviews.
4. **Summary** – XP, accuracy, and streak update.

Cards always show:

- **Sources** (UK authoritative or locally approved)
- **Review due date** (expiry/refresh date)

## Editorial drafting (AI-assisted)

Admins can draft Daily Dose learning cards using an AI prompt. Each generation creates a batch of draft cards and a matching quiz for review.

The editorial workflow includes:

- **Batch review** with a card list on the left and an editor on the right
- **Save, approve, and publish** actions (publish is disabled until approved)
- **Variations** to reframe the same learning objective in a different scenario
- **Section regeneration** to rewrite a single area (e.g. MCQ or feedback)
- **High-risk safeguards**: cards flagged HIGH require clinician sign-off before publishing
- **Sources required**: cards must include UK sources and a review-by date before approval

When triage advice is relevant, cards must use slot language: **Red / Orange / Pink-Purple / Green**.

---

## Streaks and XP

Daily Dose keeps motivation light:

- **XP** is earned for completing sessions and answering questions correctly.
- **Streaks** can run daily or weekdays only (practice choice).
- **Badges** are simple, professional milestones (e.g. 7-day streak).

This is not mandatory training. It is day-to-day practice learning.

---

## Spaced repetition

Cards resurface over time using a simple review schedule. If a card is missed, it comes back sooner. If it is answered correctly, it is reviewed less often.

Staff can see a **review queue** in the History page.

---

## Editorial approval

Daily Dose uses a gated workflow:

- **Draft** → **In review** → **Approved** → **Published**

Cards must be approved before publication. This ensures content is safe and locally appropriate.

## Insights and privacy

Insights are practice-level and privacy-safe:

- Only aggregated data is shown
- Minimum group sizes apply
- No individual performance is shown to managers

See: [Admin Guide](Admin-Guide) for the editorial and insights screens.
