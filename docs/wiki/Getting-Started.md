A simple step-by-step guide to help practices set up and begin using the Signposting Toolkit safely and confidently.

This onboarding process usually takes **30–60 minutes** for an admin lead + a clinical lead.

---

## 1. Create Surgery Admin Users
Each surgery needs at least **one admin user** to configure settings and approve changes.

1. Go to the **Admin** area.
2. Create one or more users and assign the **Surgery Admin** role.
3. (Optional) Add a **Superuser** if this surgery will serve as a central management site.

**Tip:** Surgery Admin users cannot alter base symptoms, but they *can* override them locally.

---

## 2. Configure Surgery Details
Before adding symptoms or instructions:

- Check your **surgery name**
- Check your **site configuration**
- Ensure appointment types and team members match your current setup

This ensures that downstream signposting rules point to the correct services.

---

## 3. Review the Symptom Library
Every practice starts with:

- A **shared base library** of symptoms  
- The ability to create **local overrides**  
- The ability to add **completely custom symptoms**

Recommended setup for new surgeries:

1. Browse the symptom list.
2. Flag symptoms that need **local adaptation** (e.g., different referral pathways).
3. Add local override text where appropriate.
4. Add **highlight rules** for important phrases specific to your team.

---

## 4. Complete the Clinical Review Workflow
Before any symptom goes live, it must be reviewed.

For each symptom:

- Check the instruction clarity  
- Check the safety guidance  
- Ensure the advice matches your local workflow  
- Mark as **Approved** once satisfied

**Tip:** The Clinical Review tab lets you see:
- Symptoms awaiting review  
- Approved symptoms  
- Symptoms needing updates  

This creates a simple governance loop and a clear audit trail.

---

## 5. Configure the Appointment Directory
Reception teams rely heavily on the appointment directory.

You should:

1. Import or manually add appointment types (e.g., *GP Same Day*, *Nurse Dressing*, *Podiatry*).
2. Add team members and roles.
3. Specify age restrictions or conditions where relevant.
4. Reorganise categories so they match what your reception team is used to seeing.

**Outcome:**  
Your signposting rules will now direct staff to *your* actual appointment types, not generic ones.

---

## 6. Test the Toolkit with Your Reception Team
Before going live:

- Pick **5–10 common symptoms** (e.g., sore throat, UTI, rash).
- Ask reception admin staff to run them through the tool.
- Confirm:
  - Highlighted text makes sense  
  - Instructions are clear  
  - Appointment options look correct  
  - High-risk flags behave as expected  

Fix issues now while testing is quick.

---

## 7. Update Training Notes (Optional)
Use the built-in **AI Suggested Questions** panel to help staff gather consistent information.

Examples:
- “When did symptoms start?”
- “Any red-flag features?”
- “Is this for a child or adult?”

This acts as a mini-training module inside the workflow.

---

## 8. Go Live
Once the clinical lead is satisfied:

- Inform reception/admin staff  
- Hold a 10-minute intro session (optional)  
- Begin using the toolkit for all incoming calls, walkins and eConsults  

Most practices adopt it fully within **24 hours**.

---

## 9. Monitor Usage (Optional)
If enabled, the admin dashboard can show:

- Most-used symptoms  
- Most active users  
- Areas where staff struggle  

This helps identify where further training or refinement is needed.

---

## 10. Maintain Governance
Simply repeat the clinical review cycle whenever:

- New symptoms are added  
- Local instructions change  
- Pathways change  
- Highlight rules need adjustment  

Your documentation updates will reflect changes automatically.
