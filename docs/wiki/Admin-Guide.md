## Daily Dose editorial and insights

Daily Dose adds a lightweight editorial workspace for practice learning content.

Admins can:

- Create and edit **topics**
- Draft and review **learning cards**
- Approve and publish cards (draft → review → approved → published)
- Retire cards that are no longer suitable
- Check the **flag queue** for content issues

Insights are aggregated only. If a role group is too small, the data is hidden to protect privacy.

## Managing Workflow Guidance

Administrators can enable Workflow Guidance per surgery using feature flags.

Admin users can:
	•	Create workflows
	•	Edit workflows
	•	Customise Global Default workflows
	•	Approve workflows for staff use

Only approved workflows are visible to non-admin staff.

## Quick Access (staff home screen)

The **Quick Access** tab in the Admin Dashboard controls the optional quick access buttons shown on the staff home screen.

- You can choose up to **6** symptoms to show as quick access buttons.
- You can optionally set a short custom label for each button (leave blank to use the full symptom name).
