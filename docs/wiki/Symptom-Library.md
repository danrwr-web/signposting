# Symptom Library

The Symptom Library is the core of the Signposting Toolkit. It provides a structured, searchable collection of symptoms with clinically-approved instructions for care navigation.

---

## Overview

The library includes over 200 pre-loaded symptoms covering common primary care presentations. Each surgery can use these as-is, modify them to suit local practice, or create entirely new symptoms.

---

## Base Symptoms

Base symptoms are the standardised, centrally-maintained symptoms included with the toolkit. They provide a consistent starting point for all practices.

### Characteristics
- Pre-loaded and ready to use
- Clinically structured with clear instructions
- Cover common presentations across primary care
- Organised by age groups: Under 5, 5-17, and Adult

### Using Base Symptoms
Base symptoms work immediately without configuration. Staff can search, filter, and view them straight away.

---

## Local Overrides

Surgery-specific customisation allows practices to modify any aspect of a base symptom without affecting the central library.

### What Can Be Overridden
- **Title/Name** — Change how the symptom appears
- **Wording** — Modify instructions to match local pathways
- **Age Groups** — Adjust which age ranges apply
- **Icons** — Customise visual indicators
- **Highlight Rules** — Add or modify colour coding
- **Instructions** — Full control over care navigation guidance

### Override Badge
When a symptom has been locally modified, a **"Practice Customised"** badge appears, making it clear the content differs from the base version.

### Benefits
- Maintain local clinical standards
- Reflect surgery-specific pathways
- Adapt to regional services
- Keep base updates available for future adoption

---

## Custom Symptoms

Surgeries can create entirely new symptoms that exist only in their library. These are marked as **"Practice Created"** and are completely independent of the base library.

### Use Cases
- Local referral pathways not covered by base library
- Surgery-specific protocols
- Community-specific presentations
- Temporary or trial symptoms

### Management
Custom symptoms are managed entirely by the surgery and will not be affected by central base library updates.

---

## Highlight Rules

The highlight engine automatically colours key phrases in symptom instructions to draw attention to important information.

### Built-in Colours
- **Orange slot** — Standard appointments requiring booking
- **Red slot** — Urgent appointments
- **Pink/Purple** — Specific service types
- **Green** — Community or pharmacy pathways

### Custom Highlight Rules
Surgeries can create custom highlight rules to colour-code any phrase they choose. This helps emphasise local preferences, services, or critical information.

See the [High-Risk & Highlighting](High-Risk-&-Highlighting) page for more details.

---

## Icons

Icons can be displayed on symptom cards and instruction pages to provide visual context.

### Icon Features
- Per-symptom configuration
- Customisable sizes (small, medium, large)
- Surgery-specific or global icons
- Accessibility-friendly with alt text support

---

## Age Filters

Symptom library supports three age groups:

- **Under 5** (U5) — Paediatric presentations
- **5-17** (O5) — School-age children and adolescents
- **Adult** — Adult presentations

### Age Group Filters
Staff can filter the symptom library by age group to quickly find relevant guidance. Each symptom displays its applicable age groups as coloured badges.

---

## Search

The symptom library includes powerful search functionality:

- **Text search** — Search by symptom name or keywords
- **Alphabet filter** — Quick navigation by first letter
- **Age group filter** — Show only relevant age groups
- **High-risk quick buttons** — Instant access to urgent symptoms

### Search Features
- Instant results as you type
- Highlights matching terms
- Searches across all visible symptoms
- Respects clinical review status

---

## Card Layouts

Symptoms are displayed as cards in a clean, NHS-styled grid layout.

### Card Information
- Symptom name
- Age group badges
- Source indicator (Base/Customised/Custom)
- Brief instruction preview
- Icon (if configured)
- High-risk indicator (if applicable)

### Preferences
Users can customise card appearance:
- Modern white cards or Classic blue cards
- Quick-scan mode for minimal display
- Compact or detailed views

---

## Clinical Review Status

All symptoms must pass clinical review before being fully available. See the [Clinical Governance](Clinical-Governance) page for details on the approval workflow.

Symptoms awaiting review appear in the library but show a pending status indicator.

---

## Engagement Tracking

The system tracks which symptoms are viewed, helping practices understand usage patterns and identify training needs.

- View counts per symptom
- High-risk vs low-risk usage
- User activity patterns
