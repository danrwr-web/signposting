# 🏥 Signposting Toolkit – User Guide (Ide Lane Surgery)
**Version:** Beta (Web Release)  
**Author:** Dr Daniel Webber-Rookes  
**Date:** October 2025

## 1. Introduction

The **Signposting Toolkit** was developed at **Ide Lane Surgery, Exeter**, to support the administrative team in safely and efficiently navigating patient requests. It provides clear, structured guidance on what to ask, how to prioritise, and when to escalate to a clinician.

The toolkit enables consistent, accurate signposting to the most appropriate service — whether that's a GP, nurse, pharmacist, or self-care option — while ensuring patient safety and continuity of care remain at the centre of our approach.

---

## 2. Purpose of the Toolkit

The toolkit was designed to:

- Empower non-clinical staff to triage safely within defined boundaries  
- Improve consistency in how incoming requests are handled  
- Reduce unnecessary GP appointments by appropriate redirection  
- Support continuity by matching patients to the right clinician  
- Save time by providing instant access to symptom-specific guidance  

It is **not** a clinical decision-support system and does not replace professional judgement. All use is governed by local policies and subject to clinical oversight.

## 3. How the Toolkit Works

### 3.1 Workflow Overview

1. A patient contacts the surgery (by phone or eConsult).  
2. The admin team identifies the symptom or reason for contact.  
3. They open the **Signposting Toolkit** and select the corresponding symptom.  
4. The toolkit provides:  
   - A **brief instruction** (one-line summary)  
   - **Detailed guidance** on what to ask and what action to take  
   - **Red flag warnings** (highlighted in red)  
   - **Age-specific guidance** (Under-5, Over-5, Adult)  
5. Based on the guidance, the admin decides whether to:  
   - Book a **routine**, **semi-urgent**, **urgent**, or **triage** slot  
   - **Signpost** the patient to a community service (e.g. Pharmacy First)  
   - Or **escalate** to a clinician if unsure or a red flag is present  

### 3.2 Red Flag Pathways

Certain symptoms automatically link to specific triage screens:
- **Stroke** → opens a stroke assessment screen  
- **Sepsis** → opens sepsis risk indicators  

These screens prompt yes/no questions and provide clear instructions on when to escalate immediately.

## 4. Appointment Slot Types

| **Colour** | **Type** | **Purpose / Use** |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| 🟩 **Green** | Routine | Non-urgent issues, follow-ups, medication reviews, ongoing problems. |
| 🟥 **Red** | Urgent / Same-Day | For problems requiring prompt GP review (same-day triage). |
| 🟧 **Orange** | Semi-Urgent (Face-to-Face GP) | For issues requiring a face-to-face review within the next few days. Not immediately urgent but cannot wait more than 2–3 days. |
| 🩷 **Pink / Purple** | Triage (Within 48 Hours) | For problems requiring GP review or decision within 48 hours. Usually booked for GP assessment before confirming an appointment. |

### How the Appointment System Operates at Ide Lane

Ide Lane Surgery operates a **mostly GP triage-based model**, where the majority of patient contacts are booked into a **telephone triage appointment (pink/purple slot)** before any face-to-face consultation is arranged.  
This means that approximately **70% of appointments visible on the system are pink or purple**.

We have a strong focus on **continuity of care**, so triage is undertaken by the **patient's own GP** wherever possible.  
Ide Lane does **not operate a duty doctor system**; instead, **red (urgent) appointments** are booked with the patient's own GP or, if they are unavailable, their **buddy GP**.  

Other practices with a duty system in place could **adapt the toolkit accordingly**, directing urgent or same-day requests to the duty clinician rather than to a named GP.

## 5. Key Features

- **Age Filters:** Toggle between Under-5 / Over-5 / Adult guidance.  
- **Linked Pages:** Some instructions include links to related pages (e.g. "Allergy" → "Anaphylaxis").  
- **Highlight Text:** Important warnings appear in **bold red text** for clarity.  
- **User Tracking:** The system logs which users and symptoms are accessed most frequently.  
- **Editable Content:** Admins with permission can add, edit, or remove symptoms.  

---

## 6. Customisation

Each practice can adapt the toolkit to reflect local policies and clinical preferences.

**Editable fields include:**
- Symptom name  
- Brief instruction (summary)  
- Highlighted text (warnings or alerts)  
- Detailed instructions (actions and questions to ask)  
- Links to other pages or resources  

Customisation can be done through the linked data source (e.g. Excel or SharePoint list).  

Practices adopting the toolkit are strongly encouraged to review all wording for local accuracy, governance, and safety.

## 7. Governance and Disclaimer

This toolkit was developed at **Ide Lane Surgery** as an internal administrative aid.  
It is **not an approved clinical triage or diagnostic system** and should not be used as such.

Practices using or adapting this toolkit do so **at their own risk** and must ensure:

- Approval by a **Clinical Safety Officer** or equivalent lead  
- Review and sign-off by a **GP or senior clinician**  
- Compliance with local **Information Governance** and **Data Protection** standards  
- Regular review of content for accuracy and currency  

If in doubt, err on the side of escalation.

---

## 8. Clinical Review and Local Sign‑off

Each practice must review and approve its own symptom guidance. Until approved, staff will see a banner stating the content is awaiting local clinical review.

### 8.1 For Admins / Senior Clinicians

1. Open the Admin dashboard and select your surgery.
2. Click **Clinical Review** to see all symptoms for that surgery.
3. For each symptom, choose:
   - **Approved** – content is appropriate
   - **Needs Change** – content requires editing (use “View / Edit” to open the instruction page)
   - **Set Pending** – revert back to pending if needed
4. When no items are pending, click **Complete Review and Sign Off**.
5. To re‑inspect annually (or after substantive changes), click **Request Re‑review**. This resets all statuses to Pending and shows the staff banner again.

On each instruction page (when accessed from Clinical Review), you can also approve/mark needs‑change directly and navigate Previous/Next.

### 8.2 For Staff (Reception / Navigation)

- If a yellow banner appears, the content is awaiting your practice’s clinical review. Use the guidance as an aid, but check with a clinician if unsure.
- Once signed off, the banner disappears. The instruction page will show who approved it and when.

   - Book appointment (Green / Orange / Red / Pink)

7. **Document** the contact according to practice policy (e.g. task note or call summary).
