A practical guide for reception and care-navigation teams using the Signposting Toolkit.

**Quick start:** For a task-first guide to common day-to-day situations, see [Using the toolkit day to day](/getting-started/day-to-day-use).

## 1. Getting started each day
- Open the Signposting Toolkit and log in if prompted.
- Check you are in the right surgery at the top of the screen.
- Make sure your headset/phone and clinical system are ready before taking calls.

## 2. Finding the right symptom quickly
- Use the search bar to type the main reason for contact (e.g. “ear pain”, “rash”).
- You can filter by alphabet or age group (Under-5, 5–17, Adult) to narrow results.
- If unsure which symptom fits, pick the closest match and read the brief instruction first.

## 3. Reading the guidance
- Each symptom shows a **brief instruction** (one-line summary) and detailed steps.
- Look for highlighted text – red or pink highlights indicate higher risk.
- Follow the steps in order; they are written for non-clinical staff in plain English.

## 4. Spotting high-risk situations
- Red flags are clearly highlighted. If you see them, pause and escalate to a clinician.
- High-risk buttons on the homepage give one-click access to urgent symptoms (e.g. stroke, sepsis).
- When in doubt about safety, book the safest option or speak to the on-call GP/clinical lead.

## 5. Choosing what to do next
- Options usually include: self-care/pharmacy, book a routine slot (green), semi-urgent (orange), urgent/triage (red or pink).
- Age-specific guidance may change the action – check the correct age tab before booking.
- Use the Appointment Directory if you need to confirm which team handles a specific slot type.

## 6. If you are unsure
- Stop and check with a clinician rather than guessing.
- Summarise the concern, any red flags, and what you have already checked.
- Document the call according to your practice policy.

## 7. Getting help from an admin or clinical lead
- Ask a surgery admin if wording looks wrong or local services have changed.
- Admins can request clinical review or edit local instructions; superusers can make wider changes.
- Use the in-app “Suggest a change” option (if enabled) to log feedback for review.

## 8. Staying up to date
- The toolkit shows a banner if content needs clinical review; follow the guidance but confirm with a clinician if worried.
- New features (e.g. AI Suggested Questions) appear after they are reviewed and enabled for your surgery.

## 9. Key tips for safe navigation
- Always confirm the age group.
- Re-read red flags before booking.
- If symptoms do not fit the available options, escalate rather than book a routine slot.
- Keep notes concise and factual; include who you escalated to when relevant.
