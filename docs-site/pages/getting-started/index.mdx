title: "Getting Started"
---

A simple step-by-step guide to help practices set up and begin using the Signposting Toolkit safely and confidently.

This onboarding process usually takes **30–60 minutes** for an admin lead + a clinical lead.

**Tip:** If your surgery has the onboarding features enabled, you can track your progress using the **Setup & onboarding** section in **Practice settings**. This shows which steps are complete and what remains to be done.

## Onboarding Wizard

The Onboarding Wizard is a guided questionnaire that collects information about how your surgery operates. This profile is used to tailor the toolkit — particularly when using [AI Surgery Customisation](/features/ai-features#ai-surgery-specific-customisation) to rewrite symptom instructions for your local context.

The wizard is available at **Admin → Onboarding** and has eight steps:

### Step 1 — Practice Overview

- Surgery name
- Whether you have a Duty Doctor model for urgent same-day issues
- If yes, what terminology you use (e.g. "Duty Doctor", "On-Call GP")

### Step 2 — Appointment Types & Booking Rules

- Which appointments reception can book directly (e.g. Routine GP, Nurse Practitioner, Practice Nurse, HCA, Dressings, Blood Tests, ECGs, Smears, Immunisations)
- Appointment types reception must NOT book directly
- Whether you have named urgent/same-day appointment slots (e.g. "red slots", "orange slots")
- If yes, how your appointment workflow operates (which roles book urgent slots, sequencing rules, exceptions)

### Step 2.5 — Appointment Types & Naming

This extended step maps your local appointment names to standard archetypes so the AI can use the correct terminology:

- **Routine continuity GP** — For non-urgent problems where the patient should see their usual GP
- **Routine GP telephone** — For non-urgent problems manageable over the phone
- **GP triage within 48 hours** — For problems needing GP input within 1–2 days
- **Urgent same-day telephone (Duty GP)** — For urgent or safety-critical same-day problems
- **Urgent same-day face-to-face** — For patients who clearly need examination today
- **Direct booking with another clinician** — For problems that go straight to another clinician

For each enabled type, you provide:
- The **local name** your reception team sees in the appointment book
- **Who usually sees the patient** (GP, Duty GP, ANP, Pharmacist, etc.)
- A **one-sentence description** explaining when this type is used

You can also configure non-GP clinician appointments (Minor Illness Clinician, Clinical Pharmacist, First Contact Physiotherapist, or other).

### Step 3 — Team Structure

- Which clinicians you have on site (GP partners, Salaried GPs, ANPs, Practice Nurses, HCAs, FCP, Pharmacist, Mental Health Practitioner, Social Prescriber, Frailty Team, and others)
- Whether certain symptoms or tasks are usually handled by specific roles (e.g. "Back pain → FCP")

### Step 4 — Safety & Escalation

- Who reception should escalate to first when worried about a patient (Duty Doctor, Shift GP, Nurse Practitioner, or other)
- Any specific internal wording for urgent symptoms

### Step 5 — Local Services

For each local service, describe the main service you use and how staff should signpost patients:

- MSK / physiotherapy
- Mental health
- Social prescribing
- Community nursing / wound care
- Audiology
- Frailty / falls
- Sexual health
- Out-of-hours service

You can choose whether to include local pathway details directly in symptom instructions (yes, brief, or no).

### Step 6 — Communication Preferences

- Whether instructions should be brief, moderate, or detailed
- Whether to use your surgery's terminology, generic NHS wording, or a mix

### Step 7 — Final Settings

- Customisation scope for AI: all symptoms, core set only (recommended), or manual selection
- Whether AI-generated instructions should automatically require clinical review (recommended: yes)

### Completing the Wizard

Click **Finish & Save** on the final step. The onboarding profile is saved and the Setup Checklist updates to show completion. You can return to any step at any time to update your answers.

After completing onboarding, the wizard offers a direct link to the **AI Setup** page to begin customising instructions.

### Setup Checklist

The Setup Checklist (available from the Admin Dashboard) tracks your progress:

- Whether onboarding has been completed
- Whether appointment types have been configured
- Whether AI customisation has been run
- How many symptoms are pending clinical review

---

## 1. Create Surgery Admin Users
Each surgery needs at least **one admin user** to configure settings and approve changes.

1. Go to the **Admin** area.
2. Create one or more users and assign the **Surgery Admin** role.
3. (Optional) Add a **Superuser** if this surgery will serve as a central management site.

**Tip:** Surgery Admin users cannot alter base symptoms, but they *can* override them locally.

---

## 2. Configure Surgery Details
Before adding symptoms or instructions:

- Check your **surgery name**
- Check your **site configuration**
- Ensure appointment types and team members match your current setup

This ensures that downstream signposting rules point to the correct services.

---

## 3. Review the Symptom Library
Every practice starts with:

- A **shared base library** of symptoms  
- The ability to create **local overrides**  
- The ability to add **completely custom symptoms**

Recommended setup for new surgeries:

1. Browse the symptom list.
2. Flag symptoms that need **local adaptation** (e.g., different referral pathways).
3. Add local override text where appropriate.
4. Add **highlight rules** for important phrases specific to your team.

---

## 4. Complete the Clinical Review Workflow
Before any symptom goes live, it must be reviewed.

For each symptom:

- Check the instruction clarity  
- Check the safety guidance  
- Ensure the advice matches your local workflow  
- Mark as **Approved** once satisfied

**Tip:** The Clinical Review tab lets you see:
- Symptoms awaiting review  
- Approved symptoms  
- Symptoms needing updates  

This creates a simple governance loop and a clear audit trail.

---

## 5. Configure the Appointment Directory
Reception teams rely heavily on the appointment directory.

You should:

1. Import or manually add appointment types (e.g., *GP Same Day*, *Nurse Dressing*, *Podiatry*).
2. Add team members and roles.
3. Specify age restrictions or conditions where relevant.
4. Reorganise categories so they match what your reception team is used to seeing.

**Outcome:**  
Your signposting rules will now direct staff to *your* actual appointment types, not generic ones.

---

## 6. Test the Toolkit with Your Reception Team
Before going live:

- Pick **5–10 common symptoms** (e.g., sore throat, UTI, rash).
- Ask reception admin staff to run them through the tool.
- Confirm:
  - Highlighted text makes sense  
  - Instructions are clear  
  - Appointment options look correct  
  - High-risk flags behave as expected  

Fix issues now while testing is quick.

---

## 7. Update Training Notes (Optional)
Use the built-in **AI Suggested Questions** panel to help staff gather consistent information.

Examples:
- “When did symptoms start?”
- “Any red-flag features?”
- “Is this for a child or adult?”

This acts as a mini-training module inside the workflow.

---

## 8. Go Live
Once the clinical lead is satisfied:

- Inform reception/admin staff  
- Hold a 10-minute intro session (optional)  
- Begin using the toolkit for all incoming calls, walkins and eConsults  

Most practices adopt it fully within **24 hours**.

---

## 9. Monitor Usage (Optional)
If enabled, the admin dashboard can show:

- Most-used symptoms  
- Most active users  
- Areas where staff struggle  

This helps identify where further training or refinement is needed.

---

## 10. Maintain Governance
Simply repeat the clinical review cycle whenever:

- New symptoms are added  
- Local instructions change  
- Pathways change  
- Highlight rules need adjustment  

Your documentation updates will reflect changes automatically.
