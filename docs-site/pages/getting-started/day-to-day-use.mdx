title: "Day-to-Day Use"
---

A quick, task-first guide for reception and admin staff. This page helps you find the right part of the toolkit for what you need to do right now.

**Remember:** The toolkit supports your decision-making, but it doesn't replace your judgement. When in doubt, ask a clinician or your practice lead.

## If you're answering calls

You need to find the right guidance quickly and route patients safely.

**Use:** The **Signposting** module (the main symptom search page)

- Search for the main reason the patient is calling (e.g. "chest pain", "rash", "earache")
- Use the age filters (Under-5, 5–17, Adult) to narrow results
- Read the brief instruction first, then follow the detailed steps
- Look for highlighted text — red or pink highlights indicate higher risk
- Use the high-risk buttons on the homepage for urgent symptoms like stroke or sepsis

**More detail:** See the [User Guide](/getting-started/user-guide) for step-by-step guidance on using the symptom library.

---

## If you need to check how your practice does something

You need to find internal procedures, local processes, or staff information.

**Use:** The **Practice Handbook** module

- Open Practice Handbook from the navigation menu
- Browse categories or search for what you need
- Check the pinned panel at the bottom for GP on-take, task buddy system, or post route information

**More detail:** See the [Admin Guide](/governance/admin-guide#practice-handbook) for how Practice Handbook works.

## If you're not sure what to ask

You need help phrasing questions to gather information safely from callers.

**Use:** **AI Suggested Questions** (if enabled for your surgery)

- Open a symptom page
- Look for the "Suggested wording for questions to ask" panel
- Use the suggested questions exactly as written — they've been clinically reviewed
- These questions help you gather the right information consistently

**Important:** AI features are optional and controlled by your surgery. If you don't see this panel, your surgery may not have it enabled, or you can ask your admin about enabling it.

**More detail:** See [AI Features](/features/ai-features) for how AI tools work and their safety safeguards.

## If something feels urgent or risky

You need to identify high-risk situations quickly and know when to escalate.

**Use:** The **high-risk highlighting** and **high-risk buttons**

- Red or pink highlighted text indicates urgent or high-risk situations
- High-risk buttons on the homepage give one-click access to urgent symptoms
- When you see red flags, pause and escalate to a clinician
- When in doubt about safety, book the safest option or speak to the on-call GP

**Remember:** It's always better to escalate than to guess. If something feels wrong, ask for help.

**More detail:** See [High-Risk & Highlighting](/features/high-risk-and-highlighting) for how the highlighting system works.

---

## If you're new or covering

You need to understand appointment types, local services, or workflow processes quickly.

**Use:** The **Appointment Directory** and **Workflow Guidance** modules

- **Appointment Directory** shows which team handles which appointment types, booking rules, and durations
- **Workflow Guidance** provides visual workflows for common processes like handling test results or processing documents
- Both are searchable and designed to help you find information fast

**More detail:** See [Appointment Directory](/features/appointment-directory) and [Workflow Guidance](/features/workflow-guidance) for full details.

## If you can't find what you need

You've searched but can't find the right guidance or information.

**What to do:**

1. **Check with a colleague** — they might know where to look or have seen similar cases
2. **Ask a surgery admin** — they can help find information or update content if needed
3. **Escalate to a clinician** — if it's about patient safety or routing, don't guess
4. **Use the "Suggest a change" option** (if enabled) — this lets you log feedback for review

**Remember:** The toolkit is a support tool, not a replacement for clinical judgement or team knowledge. When in doubt, ask for help.

**More detail:** See the [User Guide](/getting-started/user-guide) for more tips on safe navigation and getting help.

## Safety first

The Signposting Toolkit is designed to support safe, consistent decision-making. It doesn't replace your judgement or clinical oversight.

**Key principles:**

- **Always confirm the age group** before following guidance
- **Re-read red flags** before booking appointments
- **Escalate rather than guess** — if symptoms don't fit available options, speak to a clinician
- **Use AI tools as support** — they're optional helpers, not decision-makers
- **Ask for help** — your team and clinical leads are there to support you

For more on how the toolkit supports safety and governance, see [Clinical Governance](/governance/clinical-governance).
