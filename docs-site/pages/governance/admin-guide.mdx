## Managing Workflow Guidance

Administrators can enable Workflow Guidance per surgery using feature flags.

Admin users can:
	•	Create workflows
	•	Edit workflows
	•	Customise Global Default workflows
	•	Approve workflows for staff use

Only approved workflows are visible to non-admin staff.

## Quick Access (staff home screen)

The **Quick Access** tab in the Admin Dashboard controls the optional quick access buttons shown on the staff home screen.

- You can choose up to **6** symptoms to show as quick access buttons.
- You can optionally set a short custom label for each button (leave blank to use the full symptom name).

## Practice Handbook

> *Previously referred to as the "Admin Toolkit". The user-facing name is now "Practice Handbook".*

The **Practice Handbook** is an optional module for storing surgery-specific guidance pages for admin and reception workflows (for example: "how we process documents", "post route", or "task buddy system").

The Practice Handbook admin page is split into **Items** (day-to-day content editing) and **Structure & Settings** (categories, pinned panel, and rota) tabs for clarity.

### Enabling the module

- The module is controlled by the `admin_toolkit` feature flag (superuser-controlled).
- When enabled, a new **Practice Handbook** link appears in the top navigation.

### Global defaults starter kit (templates)

We keep a special surgery record, `global-default-buttons`, as the template source for Practice Handbook starter content.

- A seeding script can populate it with a lightweight starter kit (categories + example pages).
- Surgeries can then be populated by copying from this global defaults surgery (without copying rota or pinned panel text).

### Write access (who can edit)

- Any signed-in member of the surgery can **view** Practice Handbook pages (as long as the category and item are visible to them).
- **Surgery Admins** and **Superusers** can always edit all Practice Handbook items and manage settings.
- Standard users can only edit an item if they have been given an explicit grant for that item.

### Permissions (visibility and editing)

The Practice Handbook uses two separate controls:

- **Category visibility** (who can see categories and the items inside them)
  - Everyone
  - Roles (Admin / Standard)
  - Specific people
  - Roles or people
- **Per-item editing grants** (who can edit a specific item)

#### Category visibility

- Category visibility is set in **Structure & Settings → Categories**.
- Visibility is enforced server-side:
  - Restricted categories do not appear in search results.
  - Restricted items cannot be opened via a direct link unless the user has access.

#### Per-item editing grants (standard users)

- Standard users **cannot access the Practice Handbook admin dashboard**.
- To let a standard user edit a specific item, an admin can set **Additional editors** for that item.
- Admins can also optionally allow **all standard users** to edit a given item.
- Standard users edit from the staff-facing item page using the **Edit** button (which opens a dedicated edit screen).

### Pinned panel and rota

Practice Handbook pages show an always-visible pinned panel at the bottom, including:

- **GP taking on** (from a simple rota)
- **Task buddy system** (editable text)
- **Post route** (editable text)

The operational info panel is collapsible and remembers your preference. It automatically expands when the on-take GP changes.
