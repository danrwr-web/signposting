title: "Analytics"
---

The Analytics dashboard gives Surgery Admins and Superusers a clear overview of how their practice uses the Signposting Toolkit. It is designed to support onboarding, governance, and service improvement — not to monitor individual performance.

---

## Overview

The dashboard is available from the admin navigation at **Analytics**. It shows aggregated usage data for each enabled module, plus a staff usage summary.

A guardrail banner reminds admins that analytics show aggregated usage data and are not designed to monitor individual performance.

## Module Summaries

For each enabled module, the dashboard shows a summary card with three key metrics and a list of top items.

### Signposting Toolkit

- **Views (7 days)** — Total symptom views in the last 7 days
- **Views (30 days)** — Total symptom views in the last 30 days
- **Staff engaged** — Number of distinct staff members who viewed symptoms
- **Most used symptoms** — The top symptoms by view count

### Practice Handbook

Only shown when the `admin_toolkit` feature flag is enabled for the surgery.

- **Views (7 days)** — Total handbook page views in the last 7 days
- **Views (30 days)** — Total handbook page views in the last 30 days
- **Staff engaged** — Number of distinct staff who viewed handbook pages
- **Most viewed pages** — The top handbook pages by view count

### Workflow Guidance

Only shown when the `workflow_guidance` feature flag is enabled for the surgery.

- **Views (7 days)** — Total workflow views in the last 7 days

## Usage by Staff

The staff usage section shows which team members have engaged with the system in the last 30 days. For each staff member, it displays:

- **Staff member** — Name and email
- **Modules accessed** — A visual indicator (green tick or neutral) for each enabled module (Signposting, Handbook, Workflow), showing whether the staff member has accessed that module
- **Last active** — When the staff member was last active in the system

This helps admins identify whether all team members are using the toolkit and which modules may need further training or encouragement.
