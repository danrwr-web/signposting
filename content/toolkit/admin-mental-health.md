# Admin toolkit: mental health crisis and suicidal thoughts

Use this toolkit wording for reception and admin teams. Keep it process-led and non-clinical.

## Red slot (immediate danger)
- Trigger: the person is in immediate danger, has taken an overdose, is in the middle of self-harm, or you cannot keep them safe.
- Action: call 999 now. Keep the person on the line if safe. Alert the duty GP immediately. Record the escalation.

## Orange slot (urgent same-day clinician)
- Trigger: suicidal thoughts or self-harm urges without immediate danger, recent self-harm without life-threatening injury, or the caller is unsure they can stay safe.
- Action: same-day duty GP or clinician call-back. Escalate to the safeguarding lead if relevant.

## Pink-Purple slot (soon clinician review)
- Trigger: distress, low mood, or anxiety without immediate danger but needing clinician contact soon.
- Action: book within the local agreed timeframe and arrange a clinician call-back.

## Green slot (routine or signposting)
- Trigger: general wellbeing queries, admin questions about services, or no safety concerns.
- Action: routine appointment or agreed signposting information.

## Scripted questions to use
- "Are you safe right now?"
- "Is anyone in immediate danger?"
- "Are you with the patient, and where are they?"
- "What is the best number to call you back on?"
- "Can I take a brief summary so the duty clinician can call you?"

## What to say
- "I am going to get you urgent help now."
- "I cannot provide counselling, but I can arrange a same-day call with the duty clinician."
- "If you feel unsafe at any point, call 999."

## Boundaries and handover
- Do not give clinical advice or make clinical decisions.
- Do not provide counselling or safety plans.
- Do not ask for detailed methods or timelines.
- Record the call, slot choice, and escalation action in the toolkit message or handover note.
- If unsure, escalate to the duty GP.
